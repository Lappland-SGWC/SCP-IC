<strong><u>Item #:</u></strong> SCP-9473-IC

<strong><u>Object Class:</u></strong> Apollyon

<strong><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></strong>\
SCP-9473-IC is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell measuring 15m x 3m x 13m. The containment chamber of SCP-9473-IC must be guarded by a minimum of two personnel, trained by members of Lambda-7 in handling the entity, equipped with specialized eye protection and non-lethal weaponary at all times. Subject is to be provided with three meals per day. Access to SCP-9473-IC's chamber is restricted to Class-D personnel only. Any Class-D personnel who have made direct eye contact with SCP-9473-IC are to be terminated immediately.

In the event of a containment breach involving SCP-9473-IC, Mobile Task Force Lambda-7 aka "Stable Minds" is to be dispatched to deal and Recontain the Anomaly. All site personell are advised to follow standard Breach protocols and avoid making eye contact with SCP-9473-IC.

All instances of SCP-9473-IC-1 are to be restrained and isolated for a period of four weeks. If an SCP-9473-IC-1 instance transitions into an SCP-9473-IC-2 instance, they are to remain isolated until they are no longer under the influence of SCP-9473-IC. Personnel with a security clearance level 1, who become SCP-9473-IC-2 instance, are to be terminated. Personnel with a security clearance level 2 or above are to be terminated only if an imminent threat to personnel or containment.

Testing may only be conducted by two personnel with a security clearance level 3 or above with the approval of at least one personnel of security clearance level 4. Any Class-D personnel who become 9473-IC-1 or -2 instances are to be terminated after testing.

<strong><u>Note:</u></strong>\
Following Incident 9473-IC-1, all testing involving SCP-9473-IC is strictly prohibited, and Subject has since been reclassified as Keter.

<strong><u>Description:</u></strong>\
SCP-9473-IC is a Caucasian human male with a height of approximately 1.9 meters. It was initially located in a wooden shack on a mountain near █████, Canada. SCP-9473-IC refers to itself as "Jacob █████". The Subject will usually only display hostility when provoked and often attempts to engage in conversation with the D-classes and Researchers. SCP-9473-IC possesses the ability to manipulate any living organism after establishing direct eye contact into following any commands given by the Subject, acting similar to hypnosis with the main difference beeing that the effect cannot be forcefully removed by anyone other than SCP-9473-IC, but wears off after Four to Five weeks. Individuals who have made direct eye contact with SCP-9473-IC are designated as SCP-9473-IC-1 instances, while activly controlled individuals are designated as SCP-9473-IC-2 instances.

Studies indicate that SCP-9473-IC is able to "delay" its control over individuals for up to four weeks. It has been observed that SCP-9473-IC cannot control the same target twice. Further testing is required to determine if SCP-9473-IC can simultaneously control multiple targets.

<strong><u>Note:</u></strong>\
SCP-9473-IC has demonstrated the ability to exert simultaneous control over multiple individuals. Additionaly was observed that Scp-9473-IC-1/-2 instances can, despite beeing completly seperated, still recive orders from Scp-9473-IC.

<strong><u>Incident 9473-IC-1:</u></strong>\
SCP-9473-IC managed to breach containment on the ██.██.████, during an experiment involving two Class-D personnel who had been exposed to its mind-controlling abilities. The purpose of the experiment was to assess the extent of SCP-9473-IC's control over individuals and test its ability to manipulate multiple subjects simultaneously.

Approximat time of breach: 09:15 am.

During testing bith the electronic and magnetic chamber locks failed due to, as of yet, unknown reasons leading to Both of the Class-D personell, now Scp-9473-IC-2 instances, and Scp-9473-IC to escape out of the chamber and taking out both guards who where unaware of the chamber doors failure to lock. Both guards protective visors where forcefully removed by the -2 instances resulting in both guards falling under the influence of the anomaly.

The breach of SCP-9473-IC went unoticed untill 10:18:43, despite camera fotage showing Scp-9473-IC walking trough Heavy containment zone at 9:18:56, 9:25:28, and 9:50:40. Reason for the failure to report the breach is still unknown. It is estimated that by 9:45 SCP-9473-IC Had six (6) security guards, eight (8) researchers, and four (4) Class-D personnel under its influence. By the time the breach was reported, most of the personnel within the facility had fallen under SCP-9473-IC's control, posing a significant threat to containment protocols and the safety of personnel.\
In response to the reported breach of the Anomaly, MTF Delta-4 "Minute Man" was dispatched to delay the escape of SCP-9473-IC Untill backup had arrived. However, due to the widespread influence of SCP-9473-IC and the large number of controlled personnel, Delta-4 units found themselves overwhelmed by the amount of personell that was under the influence of the anomaly.

Shortly after an immidiate Backup request MTF Lambda-7 "Stable Minds" arrived on site via helicopters. Lambda-7 operatives were specially trained and equipped to counteract and neutralize the effects.

Lambda-7, comprised of veteran personnel with experience in dealing with SCPs that manipulate the mind, was brought in to assist Delta-4 in regaining control over the affected personnel and containing SCP-9473-IC. Their specialized knowledge and skills allowed them to develop strategies and techniques to counteract the mind control abilities exhibited by SCP-9473-IC.

Working in close coordination, Delta-4 and Lambda-7 collaborated on the ground, with Delta-4 focusing on securing the perimeter and providing tactical support while Lambda-7 deployed their expertise in combating the mind-altering effects of SCP-9473-IC. Together, they devised countermeasures to protect personnel from the entity's influence and successfully neutralize the controlled subjects.

The joint efforts of MTF Delta-4 and MTF Lambda-7 proved effective in bringing the situation under control and preventing further casualties. The incident served as a catalyst for increased collaboration and cooperation between the two task forces, recognizing their complementary skills and the need for a unified approach in containing anomalous threats that involve mind control.

The breach led to the loss of numerous Foundation personnel, resulting in a total of 53 casualties, including security guards, researchers, and MTF units.

<strong><u>Notes:</u></strong>\
Following the incident, the ongoing containment of SCP-9473-IC was put into the direct Supervision of MTF Lambda-7 "Stable Minds", due to thier proven effectivenes.\
A comprehensive reevaluation of containment protocols and testing procedures regarding SCP-9473-IC is currently underway. The breach highlighted the significant risks associated with SCP-9473-IC's mind-controlling abilities and the potential for widespread personnel compromise.

As a result, all testing involving SCP-9473-IC has been strictly prohibited until further notice, and its classification has been reevaluated to Keter, reflecting the heightened containment challenges posed by this entity. Additionally, personnel with Security Clearance level 2 or below who transform into SCP-9473-IC-2 instances are to be terminated immediately. Personnel with Security Clearance level 3 or above will only be terminated if they pose an imminent threat to personnel or containment.

Efforts are underway to strengthen the containment procedures and personnel training to prevent future breaches. Enhanced security measures, including increased guard presence, reinforced containment chambers, and improved surveillance systems, are being implemented to mitigate the risk posed by SCP-9473-IC's mind control abilities.

The incident serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of SCP-9473-IC and the constant vigilance required to contain such anomalous entities effectively. Continued research and analysis of SCP-9473-IC's abilities are crucial to develop more robust countermeasures and safeguard the Foundation personnel and the general population from its influence.
