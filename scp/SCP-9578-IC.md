<strong><u>Description:</u></strong>\
SCP-9578-IC-1-A is an oak door that was found in the city of █████████ in a trash behind the local theatre.\
There is a combination lock on the door that opens the door.\
The password is changed every day at <t:1708472201:T> using SCP-9578-IC-2-A. On that event if the door is closed, SCP-9578-IC-2-A begins to levitate and flies up to the lock, after which it changes the password.\
If SCP-9578-IC-1-A is more then 15 meters away, then SCP-9578-IC-2-A seems to de-materialize in the air, then re-materialize on the lock and changes the password. It returns back the same way.\
If you open SCP-9578-IC-1-A, nothing will happen. In order for SCP-9578-IC-1-A to display it's anomalous abilities, a person must sit on SCP-9578-IC-3.\
If that criteria is met and the door is opend, then it it will be possible to enter SCP-9578-IC-██.\
SCP-9578-IC-██'s appearance depend on the inner self of the person who sits on SCP-9578-IC-3.\
The room itself represents the mind of the person sitting on SCP-9578-IC-3.\
Inside this room there are objects associated with his fears, joys, hobbies, etc.\
Also inside the room is furniture, wallpaper, paintings and everything that has a meaning to the person, who sits on SCP-9578-IC-3.\
If the person sitting on SCP-9578-IC-3 sees his fear inside the room, then this fear will be able to leave the room, and the person sitting will lose consciousness.\
When interacting with these objects, you can influence the person's mind.\
SCP-9578-IC-2-A is a small device for changing passwords of SCP-9578-IC-1-A.\
SCP-9578-IC-3 is a blue leather chair.\
The inner world of the person sitting on it begins to broadcast into SCP-9578-IC-1-A.\
A person will not be able to get up from a chair if there is a person inside SCP-9578-IC-1-A, but if you try to remove him from the chair by force, then the person located inside of SCP-9578-IC-1-A will be pushed out of there with an insane amount of speed, that have a 0% chance to survive.

<strong><u>Note:</u></strong>\
After Test 3, SCP-9578-IC-2-A creates SCP-9578-IC-1-B with SCP-9578-IC-1-C on it.\
SCP-9578-IC-1-B is a yellow post-it with SCP-9578-IC-1-C on it, while SCP-9578-IC-1-C is the password for the door.

<strong><u>Test report 1:</u></strong>\
On SCP-9578-IC-3: D-93456\
Enters SCP-9578-IC-██: D-76598\
The room is upholstered with green wallpaper, there are many paintings on the wall, and a beautiful chandelier.\
There are many cabinets with different items from toothbrushes to figurines of historical figures.\
D-76598 walked around the room a little after which D-93456 were removed from SCP-9578-IC-3.\
After that, D-76598 were thrown out of SCP-9578-IC-██ and SCP-9578-IC-1-A.\
D-76598 did not survive the colision with the wall and the whole room was covered in blood.

<strong><u>Test report 2:</u></strong>\
On SCP-9578-IC-3: Dr. █████\
Enters SCP-9578-IC-██: D-45876\
The test were assigned due to the fact that Dr. █████ was very afraid of mannequins and this prevented him from working.\
Opening the door to the classroom, D-45876 saw a bunch of wooden mannequins. The light in the room was flickering.\
Dr. █████ saw the mannequins and lost consciousness. Immediately after this one of the mannequins were thrown outside SCP-9578-IC-██.\
Afterwards, a wood shredder was brought in and all the dummies were terminated.\
After that, Dr. █████ was no longer afraid of mannequins.

<strong><u>Test report 3:</u></strong>\
On SCP-9578-IC-3: Dr. ███\
Enters SCP-9578-IC-██: ██████\
The goal of the experiment is to find out, what will happen if you take the object out of the room.\
██████ entered SCP-9578-IC-██ and his attention was immediately drawn to a pedestal with all types of amnestics.\
He decided to take one of them and went out.\
After that, Dr. ███ (he was an expert in the field of amnestics) was asked if he knew about this type of amnesiac.\
He replied that he saw it for the first time and asked if it was a new type.\
They explained to him how this type of amnestic works and sent ██████ to return the jar with the amnestic to its place.\
██████ returned to SCP-9578-IC-██ and was about to put it in, but in the place of the old can, there was already a new one (different from the old one).\
██████ pulled this one out too. After a chemical analysis, it turned out that amnestics are different in composition, but the effect on a person is the same.\
Afterwards, scientists attempted to make many copies of this amnestic by constantly explaining to Dr ███ its principle of operation, but the third time Dr ███ became ill.\
The original amnestic was returned to its place, and dr ███ was taken to the medical building.\
He was diagnosed with severe exhaustion and dehydration.\
After this incident a cage were mounted on SCP-9578-IC-2-B.\
Changing passwords manually is no longer possible.\
SCP-9578-IC-1-B with SCP-9578-IC-1-C begans to appear on SCP-9578-IC-1-A.
