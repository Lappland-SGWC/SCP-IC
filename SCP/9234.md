<strong><u>Behavior:</u></strong>\
SCP-9234-IC typically manifests near a door or closet within a room. Only one person may be conscious during a manifestation event. When an individual observes SCP-9234-IC, one of two outcomes will occur:

2. SCP-9234-IC remains neutral.

If the individual exhibits hostile behavior, SCP-9234-IC will rush toward them and tear them apart. SCP-9234-IC will then dematerialize after approximately 5 minutes.
If the individual remains passive or neutral, SCP-9234-IC will maintain its position and stare at the person for 10 minutes before dematerializing.
Individuals report intense fatigue following encounters with SCP-9234-IC.
In all encounters involving children, SCP-9234-IC responds in the same manner as with individuals who maintain neutral behavior, regardless of whether the child displays fear.
